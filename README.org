# Building

- Change to the 'bin' directory.  (Sorry; yes, this must be your working directory.)

- Edit 'vars' if appropriate.

- Run

  - ./build-debootstrap-image.sh

    (This runs debootstrap inside a docker container.  It uses the mkimage scripts from the Docker repository.  This
    creates a pristine, baseline Ubuntu installation.)

  - ./build-customized-environment.sh

    (This exports the debootstrapped Docker container from the previous step into a temporary directory (BASE_PATH).
    Your pre-customize.d scripts are run on the host.  The 'customize.sh' script is invoked inside a container, which in
    turn runs your customize.d scripts.)  the container; see the 'customize.sh' script, which is the top-l

  - ./build-livecd-image.sh

    (This builds a squashfs from the filesystem created in the previous step, puts that, ISOLINUX, and a few
    configuration files into a temporary directory (IMAGE_PATH), and then builds an ISO from that directory.)

# Features

- avahi/hostname

- openssh

- custom software

- NFS mount

# Tips

- Testing in a libvirt/qemu/KVM guest

- PXE booting

# Troubleshooting

- If you are troubleshooting the early part of the booting process, you may need to inspect the initramfs.  The
  'bin/extract-initramfs.sh' script demonstrates how to do this.

- Normal tricks for getting access to a VM's filesystem for inspection purposes, like 'guestmount', won't work (because
  the guest's disk isn't being used; you're booting off a CD!).  However, the live environment's filesystem (the
  unpacked equivalent of the squashfs image in the ISO) is there for you to inspect (at BASE_PATH, right where it was
  built); you don't need direct access to the running guest!

# Nanual testing checklist

- Consoles

  - On the first virtual terminal (tty1), first two hardware serial consoles (ttyS0, ttyS1), and common virtual serial
    consoles (hvc0, others?)  a tty should be present.  If the autologin setting is enabled, agetty should be invoked
    with '--autologin root' so that there is a root shell on each of the above instead of a login prompt.
